System in
```python
>>> a = input('type something:')
type something:ok
>>> a
'ok'
```

Generate a range
```python
>>> range(3)   # 0 to 2, length 3
range(0, 3)
>>> range(1,5)  # 1 to 4, length 4
range(1, 5)
>>> for i in range(-3, 3):
...   print(i)
...
-3
-2
-1
0
1
2
>>>
>>> for i in range(0, 10, 3):        # 3 is the step
...   print(i)
...
0
3
6
9
```

List can be created from iterable object, range is one of the iterables.
```python
>>> list(range(1,5))
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

pass is doing nothing, it will be sliently ignored.
```python
>>> if True:
...   pass
...
>>> class AssKicking:
...   pass
...
>>>
```

All functions return value, None is for functions without the return.
```python
>>> def greeting(m):
...   pass
...
>>> greeting('hi')
>>> print(greeting('hi'))
None
>>> L = None
>>> L
>>> L is None
True
```

Function default value
```python
>>> def func(a, b=10):   # default b is 10
...   return a + b
...
>>> func(1)
11
>>> func(1, 1)
2
```
