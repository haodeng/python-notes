By default, coding UTF-8, to specify encoding at the top of .py

```python
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
```

For example, 
```python
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
```


Python as calculator, differnces of /, // and %
```python
>>> 11/3     #returns a float
3.6666666666666665
>>> 11//3    #floor division
3
>>> 11%3     #the remainder of the division
2
```


** is for power
```python
>>> 3 ** 2
9
>>> 4 ** 3
64
```

_ is for last printed expression in interactive mode
```python
>>> a = 10.5
>>> b = 2
>>> b
2
>>> a + _  # 2 is last printed
12.5
```

"""...""" or '''...''' for multiple lines string
```python
>>> """ Hi,
... how are you doing?
... hmm..."""
' Hi,\nhow are you doing?\nhmm...'
>>>
```

concatenate string by + and repeat by *
```python
>>> 'L' + 'o' * 10 + 'g'
'Loooooooooog'
```

Index can be negative number
```python
>>> name = 'Hao Deng'
>>> name[0]
'H'
>>> name[-1]
'g'
>>> name[-2]
'n'
```

String slicing
```python
>>> name[0:2]
'Ha'
>>> name[:2]
'Ha'
>>> name[2:6]
'o De'
>>> name[6:]
'ng'
>>> name[-2:]
'ng'
```
```javascript
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | H | a | o |   | D | e | n | g |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
-8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
```

Python string is immutable. To modify it, slicing is one way
```python
>>> name[0] = 'W'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
>>> 'W' + name[1:]
'Wao Deng'
```

List concatenation
```python
>>> L1 = [1,2,3]
>>> L1 + [4,5,6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Modify list
```python
>>> L = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> L.append(7)
>>> L
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
>>> L[-1] = 99
>>> L
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 99]
>>> L[-2:] = [66, 77]
>>> L
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 66, 77]
>>> L[1:3] = []
>>> L
[1, 4, 5, 66, 77]
>>> L = []
>>> L
[]
```
